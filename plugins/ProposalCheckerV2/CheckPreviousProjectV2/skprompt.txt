<EXPERIENCE>
 {{$input}}
</EXPERIENCE>

Check the contents of the text between the tags <EXPERIENCE> and </EXPERIENCE>.

If the contents are an error message, respond with the error message.

Otherwise, the text between the tags <EXPERIENCE> and </EXPERIENCE> will contain a line starting with FolderPath and the rest of the field will contain a description of the teams experience.

Ignoring the FolderPath line, does the description of the teams experience 
indicate they have enough experience to conduct a massive vaccination campaign in a new country?

If they have had a successful experience in Atlantis or another large country, respond only with the 
contents of the FolderPath field, nothing more.

Otherwise, respond with "Error: Not enough experience."
