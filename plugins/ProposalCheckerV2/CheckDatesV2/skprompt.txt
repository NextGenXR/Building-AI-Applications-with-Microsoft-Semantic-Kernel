<IMPLEMENTATION>
 {{$input}}
</IMPLEMENTATION>

Check the contents of the text between the tags <IMPLEMENTATION> and </IMPLEMENTATION>.

If the first line starts with "Error", stop here and respond with the contents of the text between the tags <IMPLEMENTATION> and </IMPLEMENTATION>.

Otherwise, the text between the tags <IMPLEMENTATION> and </IMPLEMENTATION> will contain 
a line starting with FolderPath and the rest of the field will contain 
a description of a timeline for vaccine implementation.

Think carefully about the following question:
Ignoring the FolderPath line, does the the timeline contain dates?

If there are no dates listed, say "Error: No dates listed" .

If the dates are outside of the 2024-2025 range, say "Error: dates out of range".

If there are dates between 2024 and 2025, respond with the FolderPath line..
